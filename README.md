# stat-pl
Stat.pl script

This wasn't originally mine, but I have modified it to add the -i switch that lets you get the average over some amount of time other than 1 second.  

Also I have modified it to accept newer network interface names like enp3s0f1 (when it was writen they looked like eth0), and nvme disk names.  

I would like to someday fix it so instead of listing LVM volumes as "dm-3" it should show the name.  But I have forgotten almost all the perl I ever knew, so I might never actually do that.
